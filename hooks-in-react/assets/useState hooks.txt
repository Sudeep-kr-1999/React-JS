Summary useState hooks:----------------------------------

----> The useState hooks lets you add state to the functional components
----> In classes, the state is always an object
----> With the useState hook, the state doesn't have to be an object
----> The useState hook return an array with 2 elements
----> The first element is the current value of the state and the second element is the state setter function
----> If New state value depends on the previous state value We can pass a function to the setter function
----> When dealing with object and arrays , always make sure to spread your state variable and then call the setter function
