useEffect hooks :-----------------------------

---> The Effect Hook let you perform side effects in functional 
---> It is a close replacement for componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount
---> it runs after every render of the component very important
----> useEffect is placed inside the components so we can easily access components state and props without having to write the additional code
