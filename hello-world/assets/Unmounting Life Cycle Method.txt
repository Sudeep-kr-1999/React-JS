Unmounting Life Cycle Method:

1. componentWillUnmount()
---> this method is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed.
---> in this method we can perform some clean up task like cancelling any network request, removing events handlers, cancelling any subscriptions and also invalidating timers.
---> donot call a setState() method because the component is never re-rendered after it get unmounted
