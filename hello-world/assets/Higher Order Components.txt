Why higher order components (HOC):============

----> To share the common functionality between components
----> A pattern where a function take a component as an argument and return a new component.
----> in simple code it looks like :-- const NewComponent= higherOrderComponent(originalComponent)
----> Typically HOC add Additional data and functionality to the Original Component
----> So new component can also be refered as enchanced component:-- const EnhancedComponent=higherOrderComponent(originalComponent)


EXAMPLE : ----------------

const IronMan=withSuit(TonyStark);

here:------
---> TonyStark is the original component
---> withSuit is the function which enchance the properties of the Original Components
---> With enchanced properties he become the IronMan

Naming Convenction for HOC as per the observed data all over the internet :--------


// Naming Convention for the HOC:------------

// 1. The function and the file name is usually the same it indidcates the functionality added to the component in camelCase 
// 2. Original Component is Usually Rerfered to as WrappedComponent
// 3. new component is same as the function name but in the PascalCase
