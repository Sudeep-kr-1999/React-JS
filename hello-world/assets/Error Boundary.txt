Error Boundary:==========

----> A class component that implements either one or both of the lifecycle methods getDerivedStateFromError() or componentDidCatch() becomes an error boundary
----> The static method getDerivedStateFromError method is used to render a fallback UI After an error is thrown and the componentDidCatch method is used to log the error information

----> Error boundaries are the React components that catch javascript error in their child component tree , log those errors , and display a fallback UI
---->A class component become an ErrorBoundary by defining either or both of getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch lifecycle methods
---->The placement of the error boundaries also matters as it controls if the entire app should have the fall-back UI or just the component causing the problem
----> Provide a way to gracefully handle error in application code
