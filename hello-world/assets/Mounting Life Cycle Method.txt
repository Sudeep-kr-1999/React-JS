Mounting Life Cycle Methods :----------------

1. constructor(props):--- 

----> A special function that will get called whenever a new component is created
----> Initializing state
----> Binding the EventHandlers
----> Donot cause side effects EX: HTTP requests
----> super(props)
----> Directly overwrite this.state

2. static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)
----> when the state of the component depends on the changes in the props over the time
----> set the state
----> since static function we should not use this keyword instead the updated object state
----> donot cause side effects,ex HTTP requests

3. render

----> only require method in the class component
----> read props and state and return JSX
----> Pure function
----> donot change the state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls
---->children component life cycle method is also executed

4.componentDidMount
----> this method will be called only once in whole life cycle of an event component and it is invoked immediately after a component and all its children components have been rendered to the DOM
----> Cause side effects. Ex:- interact with the DOM or perform any ajax calls to load data
	

note:----------the above methods are in the order of execution it will be executed top to down order of execution
